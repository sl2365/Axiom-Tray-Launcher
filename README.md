# Axiom-Tray-Launcher
Tray app for launching apps.

## Here are some features:
- Full relative path support throughout the app.
- Supports launching apps via Sandboxie-Plus, just add the path to SandMan.exe and enable Sandboxie in the settings.
- Folder scanning for instant listing of all apps within a folder, includes recursive scanning. You can also set a folder to scan for certain file types, default is EXE.
- Ignore list to exclude apps/files during scanning.
- Organise apps by specifying categories. The default is the scanned folder name for your categories. You can change this on a per app basis.
- Set apps as "Favourite" so it shows below categories.
- Hide unwanted apps.
- Generate shortcuts for all apps. Doesn't create shortcuts for hidden apps.
- Set Global variables for paths. Can be used everywhere.
- Generate symlinks globally or per app. Global symlink can be set to be created/removed on startup/exit of the tray menu. Or you can set them just on startup so they can be persistent.
- Per app symlinks are always created/removed on starting/exiting the app. So you can choose to use symlinks here or make them global and persistent.
- Auto-updates when new versions available. Default is OFF, so needs enabling in the Settings file. Checks once daily. You can also leave this off and use the Manual update check via the About tab in the Settings.
